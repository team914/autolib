## Docs
Head over to the documentation website:

[https://github.com/team914/autolib/wiki](https://github.com/team914/autolib/wiki)

*Note: The docs are currently in progress, so if you can't find something please [contact us](https://github.com/team914/autolib#contact)!*

## Contributing
AutoLib isn't perfect; and it never will be, but we can get it pretty close. However, without your contributions and community involvment it may never get to it's full potential. So help make AutoLib by submitting a PR.

Contributions are
accepted using GitHub pull requests; for more information, see 
[GitHub documentation - Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). In addition, dealing with git branches and forks can be tricky if you don't already know how to use them; see [Editing and Creating a new branch with git and manage branches](https://github.com/acetousk/autolib/wiki/Editing-Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)

For a good pull request, we ask you provide the following:

1. Include a clear description of your pull request in the description with the basic "what" and "why"s for the request.
2. If the pull request is a new feature, please include appropriate documentation in the wiki.
3. Keep a consistent coding style.

## Implimentation

### Robot
We suggest that you use a robot similair to the one described in the 5225A Pilons Position Tracking [Document](https://github.com/team914/autolib-pdfs/blob/master/pilons-position-tracking.pdf), however we support basically any configuration of a Skid Steer or X Drive.

*Note: Before you begin to use AutoLib we suggest that you [read up](https://github.com/team914/autolib/wiki/Basic-Autonomous-Tiers-Theory) on the algorithms that we use.*
