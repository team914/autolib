   * One dimensional extended Kalman filter. The default arguments should work fine for most signal
   * filtering. It won't hurt to graph your signal and the filtered result, and check if the filter
   * is doing its job.
   *
   * Q is the covariance of the process noise and R is the
   * covariance of the observation noise. The default values for Q and R should be a modest balance
   * between trust in the sensor and FIR filtering.
   *
   * Think of R as how noisy your sensor is. Its value can be found mathematically by computing the
   * standard deviation of your sensor reading vs. "truth" (of course, "truth" is still an estimate;
   * try to calibrate your robot in a controlled setting where you can minimize the error in what
   * "truth" is).
   *
   * Think of Q as how noisy your model is. It decides how much "smoothing" the filter does and how
   * far it lags behind the true signal. This parameter is most often used as a "tuning" parameter
   * to adjust the response of the filter.
